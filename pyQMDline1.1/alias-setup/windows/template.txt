TO MAKE A *.CMD SCRIPT RUN ON CMD BOOT

1. create a file called " init.cmd " in your %USERPROFILE% directory (aka. c:\user\username)
2. open the file in notepad and put this code in it:
[ something ] = put your own value here ( without the brackets )
DOSKEY pyQMD=cd [ path\to\pyQMDline ] && [ your python alias ( usually py ) ] [ path\to\pyQMDline\__main__.py ] && cls
2.1 EXAMPLE
DOSKEY pyQMD=cd c:\pyQMDline && py c:\pyQMDline\__main__.py && cls
3. open your command prompt as administrator and run this command
reg add "HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Command Processor" /v AutoRun ^
  /t REG_EXPAND_SZ /d "%"USERPROFILE"%\init.cmd" /f
3. reboot your machine and type " pyQMD " in your command prompt and see if it works

RESOURCE:
1. create a init.cmd file in your %USERPROFILE% folder, seperate your commands with && or write them in new lines

2. add cls at the end of your init.cmd file ( exc. color 2 && cls or
color 2
cls

3. go to your admin level cmd promt and paste in this command :
===================
reg add "HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Command Processor" /v AutoRun ^
