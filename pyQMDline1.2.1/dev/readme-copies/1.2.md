>   the repository's root 
> > you can now turn licensing on startup of pyQMDline, in path['autorun']
>   remove the './LICENSE/__license__.py' string/path from inside the array,
>   keep the array empty, don't remove the [], just its contents
> > updated ./commands/pyQMDline.man
> > optimised the way help and examples pages were loaded, redesigned the help manual
> > added partial support for directories with spaces
>```
