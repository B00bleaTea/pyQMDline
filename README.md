# pyQMDline
## command-line-like tool written in python

> * pyQMDline has it's own quirks in a way that it may do some work better than a simple terminal window
> * it doesn't take that long to set up, so why not?

### current status and current version: BETA, 1.4 final.

i can't think of anything else, i'll keep this repo running
and maybe sometimes updates, but i will no longer add new features
